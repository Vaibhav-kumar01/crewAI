I think this is how I want to approach this POC:
1) Gather a diverse dataset big enough for my POC to get people impressed and excited for this project
2) Figure out what the right agent architecture is, how to prompt all the agents and routing the queries
3) How those agents should then query the dataset
4) What the output should look like

Throughout this process we will keep reiterating the entire architecture and add details as necessary
